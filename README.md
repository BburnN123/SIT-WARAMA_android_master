#Key features of WARMA are:
l.	Assessing and analyzing:
  a)	Personal profile: we will borrow the concept from the existing tool "Road Master Test Kit" which allows the older adults to assess their eyesight, hearing and reaction time in self-administered paper-based tests. We will digitalize these tests with WARMA. WARMA initial assessments will be categorized into three domains: perception (e.g., vision, hearing and vibration sense), general physical function and cognitive function. The sensory perception, physical functions, and cognitive functions are the primary factors that may influence the ability and safely for the older adults when crossing the road. Based on the results of the assessment, the app can analyze and tailor a personalized program for each older adults so that the warning, assisting and reminding functions can be tuned. For example, after WARMA initial assessment, an older lady has been identified with normal eye-sight, poor hearing ability, and normal vibration sense, the warning system of WARMA will be emphasized on the vibration instead of the sound. Other functions can also be fine-tuned according to individual's need and ability.
  
  b)	Road: when an older adult approach a pedestrian crossing, WARMA will analyze the direction and speed of the older adults and whether the older adult is approaching the "red zone (i.e., warning zone)" or the "green zone (safety zone)."
  
  c)	Mobility behavior: WARMA application also collects location information of the older adult for their daily routine activities. By analyzing the data collected, the application will be able to provide "pre-trip" advice for the older adult before he/she starts their journey.
  
2.	Warning: when our system detects the older adult is approaching the red zone to a certain distance, the mobile phone will vibrate and make sound alert to notify the older people to stop walking to that direction.

3.	Assisting: our system can guide and direct the older adult to the nearest intersection as well as to cross the intersection safely.

4.	Reminding: while the older adult is crossing the intersection, our system will remind the older adults to look out for motorist while crossing.
